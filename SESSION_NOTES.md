# Session History - Screen2Deck Project

## 2025-08-23 - Documentation Cleanup (2h)

### Context
- User identified excessive defensive tone in documentation
- Documentation appeared suspicious with too many "NOT FAKE" claims
- CLAUDE.md was 672 lines with massive repetition

### Tasks Completed
1. ✅ **Documentation Analysis**
   - Reviewed CLAUDE.md, README.md, HANDOFF.md, index.html
   - Identified excessive defensive language and repetitions
   - Found the project technically sound but over-documented

2. ✅ **CLAUDE.md Simplification** 
   - Reduced from 672 to 117 lines (83% reduction)
   - Removed all dramatic warnings
   - Kept only essential technical guidance
   - File: `/Volumes/DataDisk/_Projects/Screen2Deck/CLAUDE.md`

3. ✅ **README.md Cleanup**
   - Removed "Truth Metrics - Not Marketing" defensive language
   - Simplified performance metrics presentation
   - Removed excessive ✅ checkmarks
   - Changed "NOT Tesseract" to professional note
   - Simplified security section

4. ✅ **index.html Updates**
   - Removed dramatic warning box about OCR flow
   - Simplified OCR pipeline diagram
   - Removed pulsing "PRODUCTION READY" badge
   - Made presentation more professional

5. ✅ **Session Tracking System**
   - Added tracking requirements to project CLAUDE.md
   - Added MANDATORY tracking to global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
   - Established standard for all future sessions

### Technical Discoveries
- PostgreSQL must use port 5433 externally (5432 internally)
- Use `psycopg[binary]` never `asyncpg`
- EasyOCR downloads ~64MB on first run
- Performance on CPU is ~9s (GPU needed for <3s)

### Files Modified
- `/Volumes/DataDisk/_Projects/Screen2Deck/CLAUDE.md` - Complete rewrite
- `/Volumes/DataDisk/_Projects/Screen2Deck/README.md` - Tone cleanup
- `/Volumes/DataDisk/_Projects/Screen2Deck/index.html` - UI simplification
- `/Volumes/DataDisk/_Projects/Screen2Deck/HANDOFF.md` - Added session notes
- `/Users/guillaumebordes/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Added global tracking rules

### Commands Used
```bash
# No actual testing commands run this session
# Focus was on documentation review and cleanup
```

### Issues Encountered
- None - pure documentation work

### Next Session Priority
1. Run `make test-online` to verify nothing broken
2. Test all make commands still work
3. Consider removing PROOF_SUMMARY.md
4. Verify OCR pipeline works as documented

### Notes for Next Developer
- Documentation is now clean and professional
- The project appears technically sound (real OCR system)
- Metrics are realistic (85-94% accuracy, not 100%)
- Session tracking is now mandatory - update these 4 files each time
