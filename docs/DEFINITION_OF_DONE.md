- [ ] **Scryfall Data**: Bulk data downloaded and cached
- [ ] **Model Downloads**: EasyOCR models cached in image

### 4. Monitoring & Observability

#### Metrics
- [ ] **Prometheus Metrics**: Core metrics exposed
  - `s2d_ocr_request_duration_seconds` (histogram)
  - `s2d_cache_hits_total` / `s2d_cache_misses_total`
  - `s2d_jobs_inflight` (gauge)
- [ ] **Health Endpoint**: Returns detailed component status
- [ ] **Structured Logging**: TraceID present in all logs

### 5. User Experience

#### Frontend
- [ ] **Loading States**: Clear feedback during processing
- [ ] **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Basic WCAG compliance (labels, keyboard nav)

#### Performance
- [ ] **Initial Load**: <3s on 3G network
- [ ] **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work without JS
- [ ] **Optimized Assets**: Images and bundles compressed

## ðŸ“‹ Release Checklist

Before any release to production:

1. **Run Independent Benchmark**
   ```bash
   make bench-truth
   # Verify accuracy â‰¥95%, P95 â‰¤5s
   ```

2. **Validate Exports**
   ```bash
   make golden
   # All 4 formats must pass
   ```

3. **Security Scan**
   ```bash
   # Check for secrets
   git secrets --scan
   # Run security audit
   npm audit
   pip-audit
   ```

4. **Load Test**
   ```bash
   # Run Locust with 100 users
   locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --users 100
   ```

5. **First Test Script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/first_test.sh
   # All 8 steps must pass
   ```

## ðŸš¨ Blocking Issues

The following issues MUST be resolved before marking as Done:

1. **Accuracy <40%**: System is fundamentally broken
2. **P95 >10s**: Unacceptable user experience
3. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Security vulnerability
4. **No Cache**: Redis must be functional
5. **Export Failures**: All 4 formats must work
6. **CI Red**: All GitHub Actions must pass

## ðŸ“Š Metrics Tracking

Track these metrics over time:

| Metric | Target | Current | Trend |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Exact Accuracy | â‰¥95% | TBD | - |
| P95 Latency | â‰¤5s | TBD | - |
| Cache Hit Rate | â‰¥50% | TBD | - |
| CI Pass Rate | 100% | TBD | - |
| Test Coverage | â‰¥80% | TBD | - |

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Improvement

After each release, review:

1. **Metrics**: Did we meet all thresholds?
2. **Incidents**: What broke and why?
3. **Feedback**: User complaints or suggestions
4. **Tech Debt**: What needs refactoring?
5. **Performance**: Optimization opportunities
